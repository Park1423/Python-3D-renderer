# Python-3D-renderer
A 3d renderer made using the python turtle.
This is only a prototype and still VERY buggy. For example, there is no proper render order and things can and will render in the wrong order. Things moved behind the camera also completely break. I will probably continue working on this. I DO NOT WANT HELP; I want to do this all on my own so that I can say that I did it. I dont really knwo how far I will go with this, but the optimisitc end goal is a functioning 3D game.
